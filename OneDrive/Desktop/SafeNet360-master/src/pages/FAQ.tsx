          question: "How does the platform work?",
          answer: "Our platform combines real-time monitoring systems, community reporting tools, and AI-powered incident classification to detect, report, and respond to transportation emergencies quickly and effectively."
        },

        {
          question: "When should I use SafeNet360 vs calling 911?",
          answer: "Call 911 immediately for life-threatening emergencies. Use SafeNet360 to report transportation incidents that need monitoring and coordination, or when you want to provide additional details and evidence to support ongoing emergency responses."
        },
        {
          question: "What information should I include in my report?",
          answer: "Include the incident type, specific location, detailed description, severity level, and your contact information if you're willing to be reached for follow-up. Photos, videos, or voice recordings can also be very helpful."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I report incidents anonymously?",
          answer: "Yes, you can submit reports without providing contact information, though providing your details helps emergency responders follow up if needed."
        },
        {
          question: "How quickly are reports processed?",
          answer: "High-severity reports are processed immediately and trigger automatic alerts to relevant emergency services. Medium and low-severity reports are typically reviewed within 5-15 minutes."

        {

          question: "What happens after I submit a report?",
          answer: "Your report is immediately processed by our AI system, classified by severity, and routed to appropriate emergency services. You'll receive a confirmation with a reference number for tracking."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I track the status of my report?",
